1- at the end of this guide, you will be provided with a link of (junk.txt) which contains multiple flags


2- using only bash terminal, try to do the following (in only one command):
    
    a- grep the provided link at the end of this file, and retreive its content
    
    b- from its content, get the flags that are in the format of: grepme{this.is.the.flag.format}
        *hint* : case-insensitive matching
   
    c- from the output of the previous chained command by far, get only the column that forms a correct english expression
    
    d- reconstruct the ouput from: words in multiple line,  to become a sentence in one line (the key)

    e- store the key in a file named: ninja.txt

3- execute another command that adds 'the entire command made for part 2' in the second line of ninja.txt


4- send the file to me in private (discord)
